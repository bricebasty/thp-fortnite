## 🎯 About

The combat game program is a text-based, turn-by-turn battle simulation. Players control a character and engage in combat with enemy players. The objective is to defeat all enemy players while managing resources, such as health packs and weapons, to survive and emerge as the last player standing. The game is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and provides an interactive and challenging gameplay experience.

✔️ Player vs. enemy player battles

✔️ Player actions: search for better weapons, search for health packs, and attack enemies

✔️ Gradual appearance of new enemy players

✔️ Player attributes: name, life points, weapon level

✔️ Enemy player attributes: name, life points

✔️ Human player attributes: extended health points (up to 100), ability to find better weapons

✔️ Multiple game versions with increasing complexity

✔️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles used for code organization

✔️ Interactive command-line interface

✔️ Dynamic display of player and enemy states

✔️ Game outcome display (win or lose)
